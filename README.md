<!-- Other options include:

## App Screenshot 

The gradient background didn't show up well on the gif, so I have included a screenshot of the app here:

## Notes

My main challenge was formatting the app using the constraint layout. In the past I have used the relative layout. In addition, getting familiar with github, git commands, and connecting Android Studio to github was a little challenging.
